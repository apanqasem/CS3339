/* Edit the program to print out the memory addresses for the following. 
 * Replace each instance of "FILL_THIS_IN" with code to print out the appropriate address
 * 
 *  1. Beginning address of global array x [ this is done already ]
 *  2. Address of second element in global array x 
 *  3. Address of local variable i in main() 
 *  4. Address of local variable y in main() 
 *  5. Beginning address of dynamic array y
 *  6. Address of second element of dynamic array y
 *  7. Address of local variable i in foo()
 *  8. Address of parameter p in foo()
 *  9. Address of bar()  
 * 10. Address of cout()
 * 
 * If you are unsure about the syntax of any of the items, just skip that part and comment
 * out the corresponding cout statement 
 * 
 * Compile and run the code. Examine the output and try to answer the questions at the bottom.
